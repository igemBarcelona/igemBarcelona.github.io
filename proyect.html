                        <p class="info__txtproject10">The iGEM is a international contest where teams of all parts of the world share their researches in the synthetic biology field. This represents an huge opportunity to form the future scientist in a community based on cooperation and exchange of knowledge. Many teams have succeeded contributing to the scientific world creating startups or just sharing valious knodwledge with the world.
                            <br><br>
                        Each group will present their results in a giant jamboree in Boston, where the teams researches will be qualified and awarded according to a pre-established statements/rules. 
                            <br><br>
                        Our objective is to arrive to that point and make our contribution to the science world showing a functional modified bacteria to prevent metastasis.

                    <p class="info__txtproject"> Metastasis, which is the spread of cancer cells from original tumor, causes 90% of the deaths related to the presence of a tumour. It constitutes one of cancer hallmarks and is described as the underlying process happening when tumour cells acquire the ability to penetrate the surrounding tissues.<br><br> Palmitic acid is one of the most widespread fat components in food such as meats, cheeses, butter and other dairy products. Besides its impact on metabolic diseases, it has recently been described to play a key role in the development of metastasis, being one of the main energy source to metastatic cells. The mechanism in which palmitic acid plays a role in the progression of metastasis is through a receptor called CD36. As recently described,  overexpression of CD36 increases fatty acid uptake, essential for tumour cell survival in a foreign environment.<br><br> Consequently, high fat diet and specially palmitic acid are believed to promote metastasis in a CD36 dependent manner in cancer patients.

                    The natural mechanisms of the E.coli fatty acid absorption include the FaDL and FaDD proteins to put the lipids in the cytoplasm. The FaDL is involved in translocation of long-chain fatty acids across the outer membrane. Also, It is a receptor for the bacteriophage T2. By the other hand, the FaDD protein acts in collaboration with FaDL to pass the internal membrane. This second protein catalyzes the esterification, concomitant with transport, of exogenous long-chain fatty acids into metabolically active CoA thioesters for subsequent degradation or incorporation into phospholipids. Is involved in the aerobic beta-oxidative degradation of fatty acids, which allows aerobic growth of E.coli on fatty acids as a sole carbon and energy source  This way, modulating the presence of both proteins, we should be able to improve the palmitic acid internalization. 
                    <br><br> Also, we will try to include in other experiment the CD36 eukaryotic protein. As the image shows, the CD36 would do the FaDD function. Is preferred to use the CD36 because of being a eukaryotic molecule, it would provide us more biocontainment. 

<br><br> 
                        The basis of our idea is to modulate the expression of FaDL, FaDD and CD36 to force the bacteria to improve the long chain fatty acids consume, focusing in the Palmitic Acid.

Also, change the glucose metabolism could affect the efficient of the lipids receptors.
                    <br><br> Taking this into account, we will also make a mathematical model of the genetic circuit of the E.coli with Cobra toolbox. For example, we know that the FadR molecule is highly related with the regulation of the expression of protein FadL and FadD. A mathematical model and its simulation would provide us a clear global vision of the system and how changing FadR presence and others could affect to the palmitic acid absorbing capacity. With this, we will be able to optimize our bacteria to accomplish the best final product.

Due that chemotherapy affects also to the microbiota of the patient, the probiotic would have more effect during the resting periods between treatment sessions. 
<br><br> An alternative application of the probiotic would be its use in dietetic products. The impact of this in the consumer weight would variate depending on diet, but anyway could have a high impact because of the presence of palmitic acid in a lot of daily use food products.
